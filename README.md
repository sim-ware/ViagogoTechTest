# ViagogoTechTest
Please detail any assumptions you have made.
assumes coordinates can be integer only

assumes we only have an option of nine events at a time (convenience, 1-9)

assumes max of 100 tickets, for convenience

Describe how you approached designing your solution to the problem.

Describe how you structured your code. Why did you do it this way?

Describe how to install and run your code and tests.
-Explain how when you've finished example in Pry, you can press 'q' to see breakdown of seeded data and if correct

Describe the dependencies your code has. What trade-offs did you make when deciding what dependencies to use?

Include screenshots of your running app.

How might you change your program if you needed to support multiple events at the
same location?
-Remove the Coordinate Duplicate Checker Function
-where located? how does it work? how does it make it easy to solve this problem?
-maybe if i had coded a grid, and actual coordinate objects (which i had thought
  of doing) it would have made it much trickier
-in this instance it's an advantage, but in interest of UX probably better to have
  a grid so user can trust calculation (e.g. Wiki Diagram Explanation of Distance
  easy to understand pictorially, hard to constantly figure it out when coding,
  assume user would feel safer with a picture of the situation)
--if we were to do this, maybe think about a select coordinate function where you
  can see what's going on based on location
-it could have an overall price comparer, instead of just one per Event Object,
  allowing the User to make a decision based on price. How would you Code this?


How would you change your program if you were working with a much larger world
size?
