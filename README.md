# ViagogoTechTest

assumes coordinates can be integer only

assumes we only have an option of nine events at a time (convenience, 1-9)

Deprecation Warnings:

Using `stub` from rspec-mocks' old `:should` syntax without explicitly enabling the syntax is deprecated. Use the new `:expect` syntax or explicitly enable `:should` instead. Called from /Users/simmy/Code/ViagogoTechTest/spec/user_spec.rb:36:in `block (3 levels) in <top (required)>'.


If you need more of the backtrace for any of these deprecations to
identify where to make the necessary changes, you can configure
`config.raise_errors_for_deprecations!`, and it will turn the
deprecation warnings into errors, giving you the full backtrace.
